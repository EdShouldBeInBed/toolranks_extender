# toolranks_extender
Extending support for toolranks in many minetest mods.

# But what of non pickaxe, axe, or shovel harvesting tools, Eddie?
The basic mod does not yet support things like the handsaws or hammers 
of glooptest or the electric tools of technic. Adding them may or may 
not be trivial (and with things like the technic tools, potentially
unbalancing) and are up to the writer of toolranks and his contrubutors.

# Why not just offer this code for the toolranks mod?
Mainly because I'm using this as first steps to learning modding myself.

# Where is X mod?
First, the mod may (like ethereal) ALREADY have toolrank support builtin.

Second, I started with the mods I use in my personal game. If you want to
see more mods supported, you can of course ask-- or better still, help out
at the git!
